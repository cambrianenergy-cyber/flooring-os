## Billing Model

### Company-Wide Pricing (Not Per-Seat)

**Why not per-seat?**

Per-seat creates chaos:
- "Hire 1 person = add $99/month" (hidden cost)
- "Don't add that contractor" (cost block)
- "Disable licenses when not in use" (friction)

**Company-wide pricing:**
- ✅ CFO understands cost immediately
- ✅ Easy to budget ("$299/month, everyone uses it")
- ✅ No hidden per-user surprises
- ✅ Scales naturally ("grew to 15 users? Upgrade tier once")

### Billing Cycles

- **Monthly:** Standard, full price
- **Annual:** Save ~5% (pay upfront for year, 1 month free)
- **Enterprise:** Custom contract (quarterly, net-30, etc.)

### Free Trial

- **7 days:** Full Square Core access
- **No credit card required** (builds goodwill)
- **Upgradable mid-trial** (try Scale features for $X)

---

## Upgrade Paths

### Core → Operations
- $699 - $299 = **+$400/month**
- New features: Roll-Cut, Seam Planning, Cut Sheets, AI Add-on eligible
- Typical scenario: Hired 2nd estimator, need optimizer

### Operations → Scale
- $1,299 - $699 = **+$600/month**
- New features: AI included, Advanced Reporting, Templates
- Typical scenario: 20+ users, need company-wide tools

### Any → Enterprise
- **Custom pricing ($2,500–$5,000/month)**
- Typical scenario: Multi-location company, replacing legacy system

---

## The Founder Tier

### Square Founder

- **Unlimited users**
- **All features**
- **No billing**
- **No expiration**
- **Cannot be downgraded**

This tier is **hard-coded** in the database:

```typescript
// src/lib/pricingTiers.ts
founder: {
  id: "founder",
  maxUsers: Infinity,
  monthlyPrice: 0,
  // ... cannot be changed at runtime
}
```

**Use:** Company founder gets full access, forever. Signals trust & investment.

---

## Pricing Psychology

### Why This Works

1. **No one feels "cheap"**
   - Lowest tier is $299/month = serious business filter
   - Filters out "just testing" users
   - Attracts professionals who know software costs

2. **Price grows with confidence, not fear**
   - $299 (Core) = "Can I trust this?"
   - $699 (Operations) = "Yes, and we're growing"
   - $1,299 (Scale) = "This is our system"
   - $2,500+ (Enterprise) = "This is infrastructure"

3. **CFO-friendly**
   - Single line item on budget (not 15 per-seat charges)
   - Scales predictably (grow users, upgrade tier once)
   - Easy contract negotiation (Enterprise known upfront)

4. **Prevents abuse**
   - No $99/month per-user race-to-bottom
   - No "unlimited users for $299" exploit
   - Extra user packs are controlled ($199 per 5)

## Feature Gating (UI Implementation)

### Not Hidden, Shown Locked

**Bad (hides feature):**
```typescript
{canAccess('rollCutOptimizer') && <RollCutButton />}
// If locked: button doesn't exist
```

**Good (shows locked with upgrade path):**
```typescript
<TierGate feature="rollCutOptimizer">
  <RollCutButton />
</TierGate>
// If locked: shows "Upgrade to unlock" with price
```

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Trial-to-Paid Conversion | 35% | Users see value |
| Core → Operations Upgrade | 40% | (in 6 months) |
| Churn Rate | < 5% | Stickiness |
| Feature Unlock Rate | 25% | Add-ons revenue |
| Avg Revenue per User | $500/year | Pyramid works |

---

## Conclusion

**The Square Platform™ is not competing on price.**

It competes on:
- ✅ Professional positioning ($299+ entry = serious)
- ✅ Natural growth path (scales with company)
- ✅ Trust (transparent, no hidden charges)
- ✅ Value (each tier solves real business problems)

This is how **regional flooring companies, national brands, and franchises buy software.**

Not with "Basic / Professional / Enterprise" marketing speak.

With a **pricing pyramid that grows with their business.**
