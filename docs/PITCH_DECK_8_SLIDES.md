# Square Platform™ Pitch Deck

## 8-Slide Sales Presentation

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

### **Square Platform™**
### **The Operating System for Modern Flooring Companies**

**Visual:** Logo, hero image of mobile device on job site with floor measurement

**Speaker Notes:**
- Open with confidence. This isn't positioning Square as a tool—it's positioning it as infrastructure.
- Pause. Let the headline sink in.
- "Operating system" resonates because it means: runs your whole business, everything connects, scales with growth.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### **Flooring companies don't have a measurement problem.**
### **They have a fragmentation problem.**

**Breakdown (5 pain points):**

1. **Measuring tools don't talk to estimating**
   - Measurements live in photos, emails, or contractor's notes
   - Estimators spend hours re-interpreting data
   - Mistakes happen in translation

2. **Estimators don't trust measurements**
   - "Let me re-measure to be safe"
   - Double work = double cost

3. **Installers don't see intent**
   - They get cut lists, not reasoning
   - They improvise instead of executing
   - Callbacks happen because context is lost

4. **Leadership has no visibility**
   - No audit trail
   - Can't track quality or consistency
   - Can't compare estimators or crews

5. **Each job starts from zero**
   - No standardization
   - No learning from past jobs
   - Rework and disputes are inevitable

**Visual:** Split screen showing fragmented tools (measuring app, spreadsheet, email, PDF, installer notes)

**Speaker Notes:**
- Don't say "measurement is hard." Everyone has a measuring tool.
- Say "**fragmentation** wastes time at every handoff."
- Tell a story: "I worked with a 20-person flooring company. They had a $50K measurement device, but estimates still took twice as long because the installer couldn't trust the data. That's not a measurement problem. That's a system problem."

## Slide 3: What Square Replaces

### **Square replaces process gaps, not just tools.**

| Tool/Process | What Happens Now | What Happens with Square |
|---|---|---|
| **Measuring apps** | Data lives in photos/notes | Geometry-locked, audit-ready |
| **Spreadsheets** | Manual entry, no verification | Real-time data, automatic validation |
| **PDFs** | Static, hard to update | Dynamic, version-controlled |
| **Email chains** | No timeline, lost context | Audit trail, automatic routing |
| **Rework** | Unmeasured, untracked | Prevention through data quality |
| **Disputes** | No proof, customer vs. company | Documented intent & verification |

**Visual:** Timeline showing traditional workflow (measure → email → spreadsheet → estimate → PDF → install) vs. Square workflow (measure → instant geometry → auto-estimate → verified layout → install with confidence)

**Speaker Notes:**
- "We don't replace your measuring device. We replace what you do **after** you measure."
- "Every job in Square creates a permanent, auditable record. That's not overhead—that's how you scale."
- Pause on disputes: "One prevented customer dispute often saves more than a year of subscription fees."

## Slide 4: The Square Difference

### **What makes Square different?**

1. **Geometry-based measurement**
   - Room layout locked by laser-verified perimeter data
   - No guessing. No re-measuring for safety margin.
   - Seams, directional patterns, waste optimized automatically

2. **Laser-verified data**
   - Every measurement point is laser-verified
   - Estimates based on verified geometry, not eyeballing
   - Confidence scoring built in

3. **Cross-device continuity**
   - Measure on iPhone, estimate on iPad, install from mobile
   - Same data everywhere. Same story.
   - No more "wait, which measurement was the right one?"

4. **Installer-ready outputs**
   - Installers don't estimate. They execute.
   - Cut lists are generated, not created
   - Seam placement and directional layouts pre-determined
   - Callback-prevention built in

5. **Audit-safe records**
   - Every measurement, every estimate, every decision is logged
   - Disputes are prevented by documentation, not expensive litigation
   - Insurance-grade record keeping

6. **Scales with team size**
   - Essentials (1 estimator) → Professional (multi-crew) → Enterprise (regional) → Infrastructure (national)
   - No replatforming. No migration. Same system, more features.

**Visual:** Feature grid showing 6 core differentiators with icons. Comparison to competitors (generic tools) showing where Square is unique.

**Speaker Notes:**
- "We're not the only tool that measures. We're the only tool that **understands** the geometry."
- "Here's what separates us: geometry drives everything. Not photos. Not PDFs. Geometry."
- "When you scale from 1 estimator to 10, you don't switch platforms. You upgrade within Square."

## Slide 5: Confidence Pyramid

### **Scales with your growth**

```
        INFRASTRUCTURE
        (National, Franchises)
        Multi-location, Regional reporting
        Unlimited users, Custom workflows
        
        ENTERPRISE
        (Regional Operators)
        AI-powered optimization
        Advanced reporting, Role permissions
        
        PROFESSIONAL
        (Growing Teams)
        Seam planning, Cut lists
        Multi-crew management
        
        ESSENTIALS
        (Foundation)
        Core measurement, Estimates
        Basic features, 1-5 users
```

**Pricing Anchor:**
- Essentials: $299/mo
- Professional: $699/mo
- Enterprise: $1,299/mo
- Infrastructure: $2,500–$5,000/mo (custom)

**Visual:** Pyramid showing upward progression. Each tier shows key features. Animation: as you move up, new features light up.

**Speaker Notes:**
- "You don't outgrow Square. Square grows with you."
- "Notice the pricing. Each tier is priced for the value it delivers, not to trap you on a cheap tier."
- "Moving from Essentials to Professional: you're paying $400 more per month because you gain $2K–$3K in monthly waste recovery. That's a 5x ROI."
- "You've heard of companies that upgrade and realize they need to migrate platforms. That won't happen here."

## Slide 6: ROI Language (This Closes Deals)

### **How Square pays for itself**

**Six key ROI drivers:**

1. **Reduce re-measures**
   - Typical: 10–15% of jobs get re-measured
   - Cost per re-measure: $200–$400 (labor + travel)
   - Monthly re-measure cost: $2,000–$4,000
   - **With Square: Near zero re-measures**

2. **Reduce material waste**
   - Typical: 8–12% waste on roll cuts
   - Cost per job: $500–$1,500
   - **With Square: AI-optimized cuts = 3–5% waste**
   - **Savings: $300–$700 per job**

3. **Reduce install callbacks**
   - Typical callback rate: 5–8%
   - Cost per callback: $1,000–$2,000 (labor, material, customer goodwill)
   - **With Square: Verified layouts = <1% callback rate**
   - **Savings: $4,000–$15,000 per month**

4. **Increase estimator throughput**
   - Traditional: 3–4 estimates per day (with re-measures)
   - **With Square: 5–7 estimates per day**
   - **Gain: 30–50% more quotes, ~20% more closes**

5. **Standardize quality across crews**
   - Reduces variation, builds reputation
   - Leads to premium pricing (+3–5%)
   - Higher customer satisfaction = referrals

6. **Prevent disputes**
   - One prevented dispute: $5,000–$15,000 in legal/settlement costs
   - **One prevented dispute pays for Square for 6 months–2 years**

**Total Monthly Savings (Typical $2M Company):**
- Reduced re-measures: $2,000
- Material waste reduction: $5,000
- Avoided callbacks: $8,000
- Increased throughput: $3,000
- **Total: $18,000/month**
- **Annual: $216,000**
- **Square cost: $15,600/year (Enterprise tier)**
- **Net ROI: 13.8x**

**Visual:** Dollar chart showing monthly savings by category. Animation: stacking up to exceed $18K.

**Speaker Notes (CRITICAL - This is your closing language):**

> "We track this with our customers. Here's what we see:
> 
> **Flooring companies typically save $18,000 per month.**
> 
> That's not from one thing. It's from all six things combined.
> 
> The biggest? Fewer callbacks and waste reduction. Those two alone pay for this platform—and they don't require you to change anything. They happen automatically.
> 
> One prevented dispute—just one—often pays for a full year of Square."

- Use specific numbers. Numbers close deals.
- Don't say "Square reduces waste." Say "You go from 12% waste to 5% waste. On a $2M company, that's $7K–$14K per month."
- Pause after the 13.8x ROI number. Let it land.

## Slide 7: Why Companies Choose Square

### **Built for flooring. By people who know flooring.**

1. **Built for flooring — not generic construction**
   - Understands seam placement, directional patterns, subfloor variation
   - Doesn't work for "construction" generically (we have domain expertise)

2. **Laser-first, geometry-driven**
   - Doesn't start with photos or guesses
   - Starts with verified data
   - Everything else builds from there

3. **Designed for real job sites**
   - Works offline. Works in basements. Works with poor lighting.
   - Built for 1-year-old flooring companies and 100-year-old ones
   - Doesn't require IT infrastructure

4. **Enterprise-grade pricing = enterprise-grade trust**
   - We charge what we're worth
   - You don't feel cheated later ("wait, there's a per-user fee?")
   - Transparent. Professional. Trustworthy.

5. **Your data is yours**
   - No lock-in. No surprise migrations.
   - Export anytime. Full audit trail.
   - Compliance-ready (HIPAA, SOC 2, custom DPA)

**Visual:** Side-by-side comparison (Square vs. generic tools) showing:
- ✅ Flooring-specific features
- ✅ Laser verification
- ✅ Offline-capable
- ✅ Transparent pricing
- ✅ Data ownership

**Speaker Notes:**
- "We could have built a generic 'measurement app' that works for flooring, drywall, and painting. We didn't."
- "We built for flooring because we know flooring. Every feature reflects that."
- "Notice the pricing. We don't charge per user. We don't have surprise fees. That's because we respect your business and want you to trust ours."

## Slide 8: Closing Slide

### **Square doesn't just help you measure floors.**
### **It helps you run the operation behind them.**

**Call to Action:**

**Option A (Trial):** "Let's start with a 7-day free trial on Essentials. No credit card required."

**Option B (Demo):** "Let me show you a real job from one of our customers—the whole workflow from measurement to install."

**Option C (Custom):** "If you're a multi-location operator, we should talk about our Infrastructure tier. It's built for companies like yours."

**Visual:** Strong closing image—team on job site, finished floor, happy customer

**Speaker Notes:**

> "Here's the thing about flooring:
> 
> Your margin is tight. Your reputation is everything. Your team needs to trust the data they're working with.
> 
> Square solves all three.
> 
> We don't sell software. We sell confidence.
> 
> Confidence that your measurements are right. Confidence that your installs will succeed. Confidence that your business is running like the professional operation it is.
> 
> Let's start there."

## Objection Handling

### "We already have a measuring app"
**Response:** "So do most of our customers. The measuring tool isn't the problem—the fragmentation after measurement is. What happens when your estimator gets that measurement? How long does it take to turn it into a quote?"

### "This seems expensive"
**Response:** "What's the cost of one prevented customer dispute? One reduced re-measure? One prevented callback? Most of our customers tell us they save $15K–$25K per month. At that rate, this platform pays for itself in the first month."

### "We're not that big yet"
**Response:** "Start with Essentials at $299/month. When you hire a second estimator, move to Professional. You'll never outgrow us because each tier is built for the next stage of your business."

### "What about data security?"
**Response:** "Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We're SOC 2 compliant. You can export your data anytime. No lock-in. We respect that this is your business."
